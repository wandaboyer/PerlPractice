#!/usr/bin/perl

# A pragma is a module which influences some aspect of the compile time or run time behaviour of Perl, such as strict or warnings . With Perl 5.10 you are no longer limited to the built in pragmata; you can now create user pragmata that modify the behaviour of user functions within a lexical scope.

use strict;
use warnings;
